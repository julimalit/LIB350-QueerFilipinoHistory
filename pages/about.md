## Our Project
This collection explores queer history in the Philippines, highlighting and honoring the stories of queer Filipinos who have existed since pre-colonial times. The Philippinesâ€™ rich history of trans, gender nonconforming, and gay Filipino culture is mirrored in its languages, fashion, and resilience throughout colonial occupations and evolving legislation. Gathered from Filipino and Spanish sources off of digital libraries such as Internet Archive, Project Gutenberg, Google Books, Hathi Trust and Spain's Virtual Defense Library, as well as cataloged videos from Youtube, and images pulled from Wikipedia; the collection explores missed narratives of queer people in Filipino culture, and of Filipinos in queer culture through digital visual and textual material. We would like to credit these institutions for making these important sources available digitally. This collection features, for instance, the Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala, excerpts from the 55 volume series The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898, the illuminated Boxer Codex, plates from the Field Museum of Natural History Anthropology collection, and queer/drag documentaries.

Kahit nasaan na ang isang LGBTQ+ pinoy sa kanilang pagladlad, at kahit anuman ang yun salaysay ng nangingibabaw sa paligid nila, kailangan natin maakilala ang istoria natin at malaman itong katutuosan: meron tayong pwesto sa kasaysayan ng Pilipinas, at may laban parin ng mga communitad natin.

Within western and dominant narratives of post-colonial and predominantly conservative cultures in the Philippines, it is easy for queer-identifying Filipinos to feel alone in either or both communities. But these identities are intricately intertwined, as depicted in this collection. And through inspiration and visibility, ang message natin ay ito lang: ang pagmamahalin ay pinapaganda ang buhay. May karapatan tayong mabuhay at magmahal, at alamin itong kasaysayan.

## Who we are
This project was created by three undergraduate students for the Winter 2025 course DSCI/LIB 350M: Humanities Research Data Management at the University of Oregon (UO). This course was led by UO's Associate Librarian, Franny Gaede with support from UO's Associate Librarian Rayne Vieger and Assistant Librarian Erin Winter. 

Project Manager: Juli Malit (3rd Year Architecture Major, Minor Digital Humanities)

Communicates to the team deadlines as well as updates to project progress. Project submissions are dealt with by the project manager.

Collection Manager: Megan Ortega (4th Year Art History Major, Minor Classic Civics )

Edits the metadata through Google spreadsheets, drafting item descriptions and ensuring the connection between repository and descriptive sheet.

Repository Manager: Kayla Kuo (4th Year Art History and English Major, Minor Digital Humanities, CHC)

Confirms that the objects within the repository are displayed correctly through GitHub, overseeing uploads and actions taken within the collection.

All team members are responsible for the creation of the collection through research, and uploads to the repository.

## About CollectionBuilder-Sheets

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a template  for creating simple digital exhibit websites by loading collection metadata directly from a CSV, designed for teaching digital library skills and easy hosting on GitHub Pages.

Using CB-Sheets, it is possible to use a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for your collection metadata, allowing you to see the outcome of metadata edits update immediately.
This enables active collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.

## Create your own Metadata

To create metadata compatible with this CollectionBuilder-Sheets instance the best way to get started is to make of copy of our template in Google Drive:

[CollectionBuilder Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/copy?usp=sharing){:.btn .btn-outline-primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
{:.text-center}

Alternatively, you can [download the template CSV]({{ '/assets/metadata-template.csv' | relative_url }}) and work on your local machine.
We suggest editing your CSV using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Calc, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), or Google Sheets (and do not suggest using Excel, since Excel's CSV output is not correctly formatted).

Describe your items in your copy of the template, following the [Metadata Guidelines]({{ '/metadata.html' | relative_url }}). 

Once you have items added you can test your metadata by clicking the "Change the Metadata" button above.
