## Our Project
This collection explores queer history in the Philippines, highlighting and honoring the stories of queer Filipinos who have existed since pre-colonial times. The Philippinesâ€™ rich history of trans, gender nonconforming, and gay Filipino culture is mirrored in its languages, fashion, and resilience throughout colonial occupations and evolving legislation. Gathered from Filipino and Spanish sources off of digital libraries such as Internet Archive, Project Gutenberg, Google Books, Hathi Trust and Spain's Virtual Defense Library, as well as cataloged videos from Youtube, and images pulled from Wikipedia; the collection explores missed narratives of queer people in Filipino culture, and of Filipinos in queer culture through digital visual and textual material. We would like to credit these institutions for making these important sources available digitally. This collection features, for instance, the Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala, excerpts from the 55 volume series The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898, the illuminated Boxer Codex, plates from the Field Museum of Natural History Anthropology collection, and queer/drag documentaries.

Kahit nasaan na ang isang LGBTQ+ pinoy sa kanilang pagladlad, at kahit anuman ang yun salaysay ng nangingibabaw sa paligid nila, kailangan natin maakilala ang istoria natin at malaman itong katutuosan: meron tayong pwesto sa kasaysayan ng Pilipinas, at may laban parin ng mga communitad natin.

Within western and dominant narratives of post-colonial and predominantly conservative cultures in the Philippines, it is easy for queer-identifying Filipinos to feel alone in either or both communities. But these identities are intricately intertwined, as depicted in this collection. And through inspiration and visibility, ang message natin ay ito lang: ang pagmamahalin ay pinapaganda ang buhay. May karapatan tayong mabuhay at magmahal, at alamin itong kasaysayan.

## Who we are
This project was created by three undergraduate students for the Winter 2025 course DSCI/LIB 350M: Humanities Research Data Management at the University of Oregon (UO). This course was led by UO's Associate Librarian, Franny Gaede with support from UO's Associate Librarian Rayne Vieger and Assistant Librarian Erin Winter. The three undergraduate students who created this collection are:

**Juli Malit, 3rd Year Architecture Major, Minor Digital Humanities:**

Juli is the Project Manager responsible for making sure we are on track with the project, and communicating deadlines/progress/issues to the team.

**Megan Ortega, 4th Year Art History Major, Minor Classic Civics:**

Megan is our Collection Manager who is responsible for editing the metadata in our Google Spreadsheets, and ensuring the connection/display between the repository and spreadsheet.

**Kayla Kuo, 4th Year Art History and English Major, Minor Digital Humanities, CHC:**  

Kayla is the Repository Manager and is responsible for overseeing the uploads and actions within the collection, as well as ensuring that the repository fits the requirements for the course and our project.

All team members are responsible for the creation of this collection, and as such some actions and responsibilities overlap. All group members worked on the repository, website, metadata, and in commmunicating deadlines and progress.
